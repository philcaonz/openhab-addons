Tested TV models:

| Model         | State   | Notes                                                                                |

| TX-40CX680    | OK      | Initial contribution is done by this model                                           |


## Discovery

The TV's are discovered through UPnP protocol in the local network and all devices are put in the Inbox.
UPnP must be enabled in the TV settings via the "Network -> TV Remote App Settings -> TV Remote: ON". This may be different on other models.  
Optional: "Network Standby: ON" and "Powered On by Apps: ON" can be set to enable power on via the binding. 

## Binding Configuration

The binding does not require any special configuration.

## Thing Configuration

The Panasonic TV Thing requires the UPNP UDN of the RemoteController and MediaRenderer as a configuration value in order for the binding to know how to access it. Panasonic TV publish several UPnP devices and the manufacturer and service names are used to recognize those UPnP devices.
Additionally, a refresh interval can be configured in milliseconds to specify how often TV resources are polled.

E.g.

```
Thing panasonictv:tv:livingroom [ remoteControllerUdn="4D454930-0200-1000-8001-A813742A3472", mediaRendererUdn="4D454930-0100-1000-8001-A813742A3472", refreshInterval=1000 ]
```
